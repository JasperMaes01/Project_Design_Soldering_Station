# Project_Design_Soldering_Station
## About this project
This project is the complete assembly of a DIY soldering station. Everything is explained in the Applicaton note (to be fount under documentation).

The finished product will be able to drive a soldering iron based on user's selected value, to be seen on the display. The fully self-designed PCB (Printed Circuit Board) can read the temperature sensor located in the soldering iron. This information will be used to control the bolt temperature based on the user's set-ting. As a result, the soldering iron will maintain the desired temperature.

This project includes some basic circuitry, such as transistor circuits. However, it is not an overly complex circuit, which makes it an ideal way to get familiar with PCB design. Moreover, the final product is also useful, so it isn't a waste of money. 

The project is based on an example from the 'Elektor' magazine. They already provided a schematic that was tested and worked without error. Based on this schematic, the soldering station being described here was made.

## Documentation
Under documentation, the BOM (Bill Off Materials) and the Application note can be found.

In the 3D design folder, the whole 3D design of the case can be found.

^^No PCB screws are needed, the PCBs can be slit into a slot, or clicked into a nice clicking system.
